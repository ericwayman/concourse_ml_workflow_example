A basic task script test

1. Pull the docker image from 
https://github.com/datitran/cf-demo
This contain has python packages installed.  Included numpy

2.  The task runs test.py in this image.  The test imports numpy and prints a numpy array.  This simply checks that the container has successfully imported numpy

Usage.  In this directory run:
$fly -t [target_name] e -c task_python_script.yml 

where [target_name] is the target we have run up.
The task specified in task_python_script.yml 
pulls the docker image.  It then copies this local directory into the image and renames it home.
test.sh, which calls test.py is runin the image.
